title: Modifying a Category
---

After a category is established, it can be edited, moved to another position in the category tree, or deleted from the catalog. If your catalog is live, first consider how the change might impact any existing links to products in the category. For example, if your product URLs include the category path, and the category name is changed, any existing links to products in the category will be broken. To avoid this problem, you can configure your catalog to automatically create a permanent redirect if the URL key changes. You can also use the URL Rewrite tool to redirect traffic from an old URL to a new one.

## Move a category

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Categories**.

1. To move a category, drag-and-drop the category to a new position in the tree.

   Changes to the category structure are saved automatically.

## Delete a category

1. In the category tree, select the category that you want to delete.

   A deleted category cannot be restored, so make sure that you have selected the correct category before proceeding.

1. Click <span class="btn">Delete Category</span>.

1. When prompted to confirm, click <span class="btn">OK</span>.

## Add event to category

1. In the category tree, select the category for which you want to create an event.

   Each category can have only one event at a time, any categories that already have an active event will be suspended.

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Event</span>.

1. In the **Catalog Event Information** section, do the following:

   - Use the **Calendar** ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}) ) to choose the **Start Date** and **End Date** for the event.

   - To upload an **Image** for the event widget, click <span class="btn">Choose File</span>. Then, select the image file from your directory.

   - In the **Sort Order** field, enter a number to indicate the sequence in which this event appears when listed with other events.

   - Select the checkbox of each page where you want to display the event:

      - Category Page
      - Product Page
