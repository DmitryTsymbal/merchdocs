title: Create order with Payment Services
---

You can customize Payment Services to your needs with helpful configuration options in the Admin.

Payment services for {{site.data.var.ee}} and {{site.data.var.ce}} offer registered customers who need assistance, the ability to fulfill an order directly from the Admin. The **Create New Order** form includes all the information that is needed to complete the normal checkout process, including hosted fields with credit card information. See [Creating an order]({% link customers/customer-account-create-order.md %}) for detailed information on the required steps.
